# Musical Library CLI

* This is a small command line tool to add music to an in-memory musical library!
* To get started, run the binary **music** file by typing `./music` within the `music_library_cli` directory
* Follow the instructions from there!
* If you get lost, type HELP to find your way.

* If you want to check out the tests (to verify your musical library is doing what it should) type `rspec cli/music_library.rb`

## Dependencies
* for this application to run, you will need a version of RUBY to run the ruby interpreter, and you will need RSPEC installed to run the test suite
